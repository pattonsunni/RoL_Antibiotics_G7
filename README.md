# RoL_Antibiotics_G7_2021

This repository contains R code for sequence processing and analysis of 16S coral microbiome data from an antibiotic challenge experiment conducted in 2021. DADA2 and phyloseq were mainly used in the analysis. Scripts include data pre-processing, ecological analyses, and statistical analyses. Output files from the analysis, and pertinent R objects are also found here. Removing primers from raw sequences, aligning sequences, and tree building were all done on the command line. Scripts for these are also found here.
