# RoL_Antibiotics_G7_2021

This repository contains R code for sequence processing and analysis of 16S coral microbiome data from an antibiotic challenge experiment using a disease-resistant Acropora cervicornis genotype. DADA2 and phyloseq were mainly used in the analysis. Scripts include data pre-processing, ecological analyses, and statistical analyses. Output files from the analysis, and pertinent R objects are also found here. Removing primers from raw sequences, aligning sequences, and tree building were all done on the command line. Scripts for these are also found here.

The manuscript titled "Antibiotic type and dose variably affect microbiomes of a disease-resistant Acropora cervicornis genotype" is now published in Environmental Microbiome https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12049008/.
